# NextGram

This is a sample Next.js application that takes advantage of the advanced routing capabilities.

👍 If you are looking for the TypeScript version, please check out this repository: [next-gram-ts](https://github.com/ala-garbaa-pro/next-gram-ts).



The photo route can be attached to _two distinct_ components:

1. When navigating within the application, it is rendered as a modal
1. When the page is refreshed, it is rendered as a standalone page
